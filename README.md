### Overview
This course will cover concepts and strategies for working more effectively with Python with the aim of writing **reusable code**. In the morning session, we will briefly go over the **basic syntax, data structures and control statements**. This will be followed by an introduction to writing **user-defined functions**. We will finish the course by looking into how to incorporate existing python modules and packages into **your programs** (e.g. Matplotlib and Biopython) as well as writing **your own modules**. 

All materials available [here](https://github.com/semacu/python-functions-and-modules/blob/master/python_fm_intro.ipynb).

This is a one-day continuation course of the [Introduction to Solving Biological Problems with Python](https://github.com/pycam/python-basic).
